                <blockquote>
                <p>"My journey has been one of resilience, determination, and the courage to redefine my path. After graduating as salutatorian of my high school class, I began my college journey at FAMU in 2021. However, after two semesters, I made the bold decision to take a step back and focus on entrepreneurship, dedicating time to personal growth and pursuing my passion for the beauty industry.

In November 2023, the birth of my first child became a turning point, sparking a renewed sense of purpose and motivating me to return to school. I earned my Associate in Arts degree in Health Sciences in Summer 2024 and re-enrolled at FAMU to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. Now a junior, I’m channeling my creativity and drive into mastering graphic design and exploring the intersection of technology and artistry.

Balancing my roles as a student, entrepreneur, and mother has been both challenging and deeply rewarding. My journey has taught me that it’s never too late to pursue your dreams and that life’s challenges can inspire the drive to achieve greatness. I am committed to creating a future filled with purpose and possibility, not only for myself but for my child as well."</p>
